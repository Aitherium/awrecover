> **The Aither World** is an operating system for agents — a Linux you can hand to one, the runtimes it works in, and the tools it works with. [awnix](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) is the Linux underneath it; **awrecover** is one of its 33 bricks — each installs on its own, runs offline, and needs no account.

> **Start here:** Snapshot one directory, break it, restore it, diff it.

<!-- aither-header:end -->

Snapshot a directory, and get it back — with proof that you can.

```bash
pip install awrecover

awrecover snapshot ./run --store .snaps --label pre-finetune
awrecover verify   --store .snaps --label pre-finetune      # RESTORES it, to a scratch dir
awrecover restore  --store .snaps --label pre-finetune --dest ./run
```

Python 3.10+. `awrecover` needs [`awshare`](https://github.com/Aitherium/awshare),
which it installs with; add `pip install "awshare[seal]"` if you want snapshots
signed as well as digested.

## Deliberately thin

A snapshot **is** an awshare bundle. Archiving, digesting, atomic writes, path
containment, refusing symlinks and bounding expansion are all awshare's job and
are not reimplemented here. awrecover adds exactly two things awshare has no
opinion about:

- **a label index**, so you say `pre-finetune` instead of remembering a digest
- **a restore that fully lands or does not land at all**

If you want a bundle, use awshare. You want awrecover when you will be coming
back for it under a name, possibly in a hurry.

## Two rules it exists to enforce

### A backup nobody has restored is a hypothesis

`verify` does not check that the archive exists, or that it is a plausible size.
Those pass for a snapshot **of the wrong directory**, a truncated one, and one
taken of nothing at all. It restores into a scratch directory, through the same
code path a real restore uses, and throws the result away.

```bash
awrecover verify --store .snaps --label pre-finetune
# 0  restorable — this really came back
# 1  checked, and it is NOT restorable
# 2  could not check at all
```

Exit 1 and exit 2 stay separate for the reason they always must: collapsing them
turns *"I could not check this"* into *"it checked out"*.

There is a narrower version of the same trap inside `verify` itself. A label can
be present in the index while its manifest is gone — so the index says the
backup exists and the backup does not. That is reported as its own error, in
those words: **the index is a claim; the archive is the backup.**

### A half-restore is worse than no restore

It destroys the working state *and* fails to deliver the snapshot. So `restore`
never writes into the target:

```
1. unpack into a staging dir BESIDE dest      (a failure here changes nothing)
2. verify the staged tree
3. move dest aside     -> .awrecover-replaced-<label>-<pid>
4. rename staging      -> dest
```

The window where neither tree is in place is **one rename wide**. And the tree
it replaced is *moved aside, not deleted* — if the swap fails, your old state is
still there under a name you can find. Pass `--discard-replaced` when you are
sure and want the space back.

If anything fails before step 3, the error says `Nothing was changed`, and it is
telling the truth.

## Everything it does

| | |
|---|---|
| `awrecover snapshot DIR --store S --label L [--seal] [--key-path P]` | take one |
| `awrecover list --store S` | label, when, digest, file count |
| `awrecover verify --store S --label L [--key K]` | prove it restores |
| `awrecover restore --store S --label L --dest D [--key K] [--discard-replaced]` | put it back |
| `awrecover drop --store S --label L` | remove one — explicit, never implicit |
| `awrecover doctor` | what is installed, and whether the store answers |

```python
import awrecover
from pathlib import Path

awrecover.snapshot(Path("run"), Path(".snaps"), "pre-finetune")
awrecover.verify(Path(".snaps"), "pre-finetune")          # raises if it will not restore
r = awrecover.restore(Path(".snaps"), "pre-finetune", Path("run"))
r["replaced"]   # where your previous tree went

awrecover.latest(Path(".snaps"))        # the most recent Snapshot, or None
awrecover.list_snapshots(Path(".snaps"))
```

`--key` on `verify` and `restore` is passed through to awshare, so a snapshot
can be required to come from a **known publisher** and not merely to be intact.
Integrity and provenance are two questions; awshare answers the first and
[`awseal`](https://github.com/Aitherium/awseal) the second.

## The aw family

Standalone tools that share one idea: **replace something you would otherwise have to _trust_ with something you can _check_.**

Each installs on its own, works offline, and needs no account.

[**awnix**](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) is the ground floor — A Linux you can hand to an agent — immutable base, capabilities included.
